/*
 * PrivateAPI.swift — Undocumented CGEvent fields and private CGS functions
 *
 * macOS does not provide a public API for querying or switching Spaces
 * (virtual desktops). The constants and function pointers below are
 * resolved at runtime via dlsym and give us the ability to:
 *
 *   - Construct synthetic DockSwipe gesture events (the CGEvent field IDs)
 *   - Query the current space and enumerate all spaces per display (CGS functions)
 *   - Map window IDs to the space they belong to (SLSCopySpacesForWindows)
 *
 * These are the main fragility points of the app — they rely on
 * implementation details of macOS that may change in future releases.
 *
 * References:
 *   - https://github.com/jurplel/InstantSpaceSwitcher (original technique)
 *   - CGSInternal headers (community-maintained)

// MARK: - Undocumented CGEvent Field IDs
//
// These raw integer IDs identify private fields on CGEvent objects.
// They are used to construct the synthetic DockSwipe gesture events
// that trick the Dock into performing an instant (non-animated) space switch.
//
// To update these if Apple changes them, compare against the CGSInternal
// headers or reverse-engineer the Dock's event handling.

/// Internal event type discriminator.
/// Distinguishes gesture events, dock-control events, and normal input events.
let kCGSEventTypeField            = CGEventField(rawValue: 55)!

/// Identifies the HID gesture type.
/// For space switching, this is set to `kIOHIDEventTypeDockSwipe` (23).
let kCGEventGestureHIDType        = CGEventField(rawValue: 110)!

/// Vertical scroll component of the gesture.
/// Set to 0 for horizontal swipes (space switching is purely horizontal).
let kCGEventGestureScrollY        = CGEventField(rawValue: 119)!

/// Indicates whether the gesture involves a swipe motion.
/// Set to 1 (true) for all space-switch gestures.
let kCGEventGestureSwipeMotion    = CGEventField(rawValue: 123)!

/// How far the swipe has progressed.
/// Values of +-2.0 indicate a fully committed swipe that should switch immediately.
let kCGEventGestureSwipeProgress  = CGEventField(rawValue: 124)!

/// Horizontal velocity of the swipe.
/// Values of +-400 are well above the Dock's threshold for "instant" switching.
let kCGEventGestureSwipeVelocityX = CGEventField(rawValue: 129)!

/// Vertical velocity of the swipe.
/// Set to 0 for horizontal swipes.
let kCGEventGestureSwipeVelocityY = CGEventField(rawValue: 130)!

/// The phase of the gesture lifecycle.
/// Began (1) signals the start; Ended (4) signals completion with final velocity.

/// Bitfield encoding the swipe direction.
/// 0 = swipe left (move to previous space), 1 = swipe right (move to next space).
let kCGEventScrollGestureFlagBits = CGEventField(rawValue: 135)!

/// Zoom/delta field repurposed to carry a non-zero epsilon value.
/// The Dock checks this field and ignores the gesture if it's exactly zero.
/// Setting it to `Float.leastNonzeroMagnitude` satisfies the check.
let kCGEventGestureZoomDeltaX     = CGEventField(rawValue: 139)!

// MARK: - Undocumented Event Type Constants

// These integer values identify specific event subtypes used in the
// synthetic gesture events. They correspond to internal HID and CGS enums.

// we resolve at runtime. Each typedef matches the actual symbol's ABI

// and the features that depend on it will gracefully no-op.
