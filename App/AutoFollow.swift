/*
 * AutoFollow.swift — Feature 2: Auto-follow on Cmd+Tab
 *
 * When the user activates an app (via Cmd+Tab, Dock click, etc.),
 * this observer checks whether the app's windows are on a different space.
 * If so, it switches to that space instantly, then brings the app to front.
 *
 * This makes Cmd+Tab behave as if all apps are on the current space —
 * you never see the slow sliding animation to reach a distant desktop.
