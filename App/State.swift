/*
 * State.swift — Global runtime state and persistence
 *
 * All mutable runtime state lives here as module-level globals.
 * This is intentional: the app is a single-process menu bar utility
 * with no concurrency beyond the main thread, so global state is
 * simpler and more appropriate than a singleton class.
 *
 * Persisted values are backed by UserDefaults under the "spacerabbit." prefix.

/// Used to suppress auto-follow immediately after an instant-switch,
