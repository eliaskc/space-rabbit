# 🐇 Space Rabbit

Instant space switching on macOS. Remove animations when switching macOS Spaces. Reclaim hours of your time every month.

📦 **[Download Space Rabbit here](https://space-rabbit.app)**

## Features

- ✅ **Instant space switch** - your keyboard shortcut switches spaces with zero animation
- ✅ **Auto-follow on Cmd+Tab** - switching to an app on another space takes you there instantly
- ✅ **Reads your shortcuts** - picks up your bindings from System Settings automatically
- ✅ **No SIP changes needed** - just classic accessibility permissions

## Install

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Tahul/space-rabbit/releases) and drag **Space Rabbit.app** into your Applications folder.

Grant Accessibility access when prompted (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility).

## Setup

For the Cmd+Tab feature, turn off macOS's built-in animated space switching:

> **System Settings → Desktop & Dock** → disable **"When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application"**

## Uninstall

Quit Space Rabbit from the menu bar, then delete **Space Rabbit.app** from your Applications folder.

## Build from source

```bash
make app
```

Requires Xcode command line tools and a valid Developer ID for signing.

If you don't, you will be asked for your signature key identifier when building the app. 

## Release & notarize

👉 _This procedure is only used by repository maintainers to release new versions of Space Rabbit._

Prior to distributing a release, create a new Git tag so that the new version is picked up during build. Tags should be formatted as such: `v1.0.0`.

Once tagged, you can build `Space Rabbit.app`:

```bash
make app
```

You can configure your signing key by creating a `local.env` file with eg.:

```bash
export SIGN_ID=Developer ID Application: Your Developer Name (IDENTIFIER_HERE)
```

Finally, it needs to be packaged and notarized into `Space-Rabbit.dmg` as such:

```bash
make dmg && \
  make notarize
```

When the final DMG has been packaged and notarized, simply draft a new release on [space-rabbit/releases](https://github.com/Tahul/space-rabbit/releases) and upload `Space-Rabbit.dmg`.

The website does not need to be updated, since the download button points to the `Space-Rabbit.dmg` file from the latest release.

## How it works

Posts synthetic high-velocity DockSwipe gesture events.

The Dock processes these as a completed trackpad swipe and switches instantly.

Based on the technique from [InstantSpaceSwitcher](https://github.com/jurplel/InstantSpaceSwitcher).

## Known limitations

- Trackpad swipe gestures still animate (they bypass the event tap)
- While it skips apps present in Cmd+Tab list, it will still animate to first space when selecting Finder without opened windows — native behavior that can't be bypassed
- Cmd+Tab to fullscreen apps may briefly flicker
- May break on future macOS updates (uses undocumented CGEvent fields)
